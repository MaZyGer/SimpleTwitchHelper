# Simple Twitch Helper
a simple but powerfull dashboard for twitch.tv

Simple Twitch Helper (STH) is a .wpf application programmed in c#. It's simple as possible and you only need one window to controll everything. You can assign hotbar-buttons, startup programms, set your stream title and game & even more!

##Features
- view all important stats
- set/get stream title & game
- setup a tweet template, for one-click tweets
- setup a simple countdown and print the time to a file (with custom string formatting)
- access the orginal twitch.tv chat
- view a list of viewers
- distraction-free mode: double-click the status bar to hide the stats and viewers panel
- commercial control center (if enabled in settings)
- something missing? tweet me: @miichidk !
